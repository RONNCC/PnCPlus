There are two ways to map words to some base/root form: stemming and
lemmatization. Stemming does not appear to be a good choice as it does not
take into consideration the context of the use of the word nor does it
necessarily map words to the real base form of the word (just some sort of
truncation that serves as a unique key). Therefore, we should go with
lemmatization which takes into consideration the part of speech of the work
and maps forms of words to the real base word. Lemmatisation is more
process-heavy, but this does not really mmatter to us.
